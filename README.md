# MMF1941 Dynamic Data Science Project: Dynamic Shrinkage Method for Hierarchical Risk Parity (DS-HRP)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and research paper for the project **"Dynamic Shrinkage Method for Hierarchical Risk Parity to Improve Portfolio Stability and Performance"** developed for the **MMF1941 Dynamic Data Science** course at the University of Toronto.

The project introduces a novel portfolio optimization approach, **Dynamic Shrinkage Hierarchical Risk Parity (DS-HRP)**, designed to enhance the traditional **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)** method by incorporating dynamic shrinkage in the covariance matrix estimation. This method improves portfolio robustness, reduces estimation errors, and enhances performance, especially in volatile and high-dimensional financial markets.

## Key Concepts

- **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP):** A clustering-based portfolio optimization technique that avoids inverting the covariance matrix, addressing the instability of traditional mean-variance optimization.  
- **Dynamic Shrinkage:** An adaptive approach to adjust the covariance matrix by shrinking eigenvalues based on market conditions, improving portfolio stability.  
- **Covariance Matrix Estimation:** DS-HRP introduces a cluster-specific shrinkage factor to stabilize covariance matrices, mitigating noise and enhancing risk distribution.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Used to evaluate the performance of DS-HRP against standard HRP and Markowitzâ€™s Critical Line Algorithm (CLA) across various market scenarios.


## Methodology

1. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Groups assets based on their pairwise correlations to build a hierarchical tree.  
2. **Dynamic Covariance Shrinkage:** Adjusts the covariance matrix dynamically to minimize the influence of unstable eigenvalues.  
3. **Quasi-Diagonalization:** Reorders the covariance matrix to isolate within-cluster correlations, improving stability.  
4. **Recursive Bisection:** Allocates capital proportionally to risk across clusters.  
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses Sharpe Ratio, volatility, and maximum drawdown through backtesting on cryptocurrency datasets.


## Results

- **Enhanced Stability:** DS-HRP achieved more stable portfolio allocations compared to standard HRP and CLA, especially during periods of market volatility.  
- **Superior Performance:** The model delivered higher Sharpe Ratios and reduced portfolio concentration risk.  
- **Robust to Market Changes:** Outperformed traditional models under extreme market conditions by dynamically adjusting to asset correlations.
